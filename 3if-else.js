// JavaScript Challenges
// 3. JS If/else
// - Challenge 1:

//   Create a variable called password.

//   Check how many letters are in the password, if there are less than 8 log to the console that the password is too short. Otherwise log the password to the console.

 

// - Challenge 2:

//   Create a variable called num.

//   Check if the variable is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is log “This number is divisible by 3 or 5” to the console. Otherwise log “This number is not divisible by 3 or 5”.


// - Challenge 3:

//   Create a variable called num.

//   If num is divisible by 3 log “fizz” to the console, if it’s divisible by 5 log “buzz” to the console, if it’s divisible by both 3 and 5 log “fizz buzz” to the console. Otherwise log num to the console.


// - Challenge 4:

//   Create a variable called num.

//   Check if the number is a palindrome (looks the same forward as it does backwards e.g. 1001 or 20202).


// - Challenge 5:

//   Create a variable called time, a variable called placeOfWork and a variable called townOfHome.

//   Create an if statement that logs to the console where someone is at times of the day. E.g. if the time is 7 I’m at home, at 8 I’m commuting, at 9 I’m at work.


// - Challenge 6:

//   Take the string

//   “jrfndklhgfndjkjlkgperfijfhdknsadcvjhiiohjfkledsopiuhgtyujwsdxcvhgfdjhiopiwquhejkdsoiufghedjwshi”.

//   Find the index of the last vowel in the string.


// - Challenge 7:

//   Create a variable called word that takes a string.

//   Create an if statement that checks if the last letter is the same as the first. If it is return true, otherwise return false.


// - Challenge 8:

//   Create two variables called num1 and num2.

//   Create an if statement that checks if the result of the sum is even. If it is return the number, otherwise return the numbers multiplied together.


// - Challenge 9:

//   Let's go back to our naughts and crosses board

//   Write an if statement that checks if the items on the top row meet a winning condition. So the top row are all ‘o’s or all ‘x’s.
